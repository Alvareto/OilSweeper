# OilSweeper

Mobile or web application.
Game simmilar to popular Minesweeper, but with oil fields instead of mines. Has an element of geography in it, with map of Croatia and its oil reserves.
As Ivan K. said:
> posao s naftom ^^ Ležišta u HR, načini eksploatacije i igra minesweepera s kartom (nalazišta su i na kopnu). I njezin brat plin, također.

# Educational purpose

The main objective of this app is to educate people about oil and gas drilling. The minesweeper is only a quiz replacement, because no one in the class had that one before.
